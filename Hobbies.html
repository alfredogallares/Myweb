        <h1>Hobbies:</h1>
        <p> My interest include playing basketball, which I've been passionate about since I was a young child and 
            about which my brothers will also have an influence 
            Playing the guitar, which I loved to play from the beggining, and cooking in our home, which I've learned   
            to do when my parents would leave and I was the only one left.
            In addition, I enjoy doing things that will help me become a better version of myself.
            and Reading, Reading is aslo my hobby that not only enhances my knowledge but also improves focus,
            concentration, and empathy. It can broaden one's perspective and stimulate my mind
